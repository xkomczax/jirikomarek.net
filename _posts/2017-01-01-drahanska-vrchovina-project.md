Bounded by the vast flat land, Drahanská vrchovina highland stick out from Haná and Malá Haná regions. Norther part is gently turning into Zábřežská vrchovina while southern part is dominated by the Moravian Karst area. 

Apart from the eastern and western boundaries characterised by deep valleys and steep slopes, the plateau itself is domniated by mildly waved landscape. 

## My Homeland
Being born and growing up in the heart of Drahanská vrchovina, my earliest memories are linked with the meadows, forests and creeks running through the highland.
