## Moonbow in Yosemite Valley
A moonbow is a rare and beautiful natural wonder that occurs when the moonlight hits water droplets in the air. Yosemite Falls is one of the best places in the world to photograph them. They are located in Yosemite National Park in California and offer a unique and stunning setting for capturing this ethereal phenomenon. To capture it, you need the set-up to be just right - the skies have to be clear, and the moon has to be around its fullest, but it can't be hidden behind the Sentinel Dome on the opposite side of the valley. These circumstances are hard to meet, so it appears only a few times per year - but it is always a spectacular view.
