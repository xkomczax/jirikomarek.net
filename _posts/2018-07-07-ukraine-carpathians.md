Our trip to Ukrainian Carpathians started on a rainy Sunday in a small town Volovets (Воловець), where we were transported by local *marshrutka* from Mukachevo (Мукачево). At the bus stop, a lonely dog accompanies us, even though we were trying to repeal him.

## Polonina Borshava (Полонина Боржава)
Right at the edge of the town, we begin to climb up the slippy hills of Voskresensʹkyy Verkh (Воскресенський Верх). The right adventure started in the forest, where the path turned into a water stream during the rain. We were meeting groups of blueberries pickers going down from their shift. We pitched our tent a few meters under the peak to stay in windless conditions but having a chance to capture the mountains during the sunset and sunrise. It turned out to be a great decision because the mixture of lowly shining sun and cloudy weather created many beautiful sceneries.

## Wełkyj Werch (Великий Верх) in a windy weather
The weather on the very first day changed from a warm morning to a windy and cold day. We were passing the highest peak of our trip, Wełkyj Werch, wearing all the possible clothes we had.

Fortunately, the weather becomes more hospitable in the next few days and we were able to continue to Mizhhirya (Міжгір’я) without any issues. The mountain rig was full of people: a lot of tourists (many of them from the Czech Republic - because this area was once part of Czechoslovakia known as Zakarpatská Ukrajina) and local blueberries pickers.

## Mizhhirya, Synevyr, Nehrovets and Kolochava
After we come down from the mountains into the valley of the Rika river (Ріка), we passed the town of Mizhhirya (Міжгір’я) and continued in the north-east direction. The meadows were full of blooming flowers, we were passing small fields and old wooden houses. The area was part of the National Nature Park Synevyr (Синевир), which covers the entire surrounding of the village of the same name, including the famous Synevyr lake.

We passed the village, walked through the village of Nehrovets (Негровець) with many old wooden houses and wooden churches to reach our final destination, Kolochava (Колочава).

## The legend of Nikola Šuhaj
Kolochava is the place where the story of *Nikola Šuhaj loupežník* novel (written by Ivan Olbracht) took place. The story of the feared robber of legend (similar to Robin Hood) is however strongly glamorized.

This was also the place, where we had to say goodbye to our devoted dog mate. He guarded us through the whole journey, always friendly to us, but at the same time hostile to potential enemies. For his service, he was well fed. From Kolochava, we took a local taxi which drove us through once-by-floods-destroyed-never-fixed road to our final destination, Khust (Хуст).
