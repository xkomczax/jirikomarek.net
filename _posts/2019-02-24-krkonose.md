With the highest peak Sněžka just slightly surpassing the 1600 meters line, Krkonoše doesn't belong to the world's highest mountains. However, they are the highest mountains of the Czech Republic with the oldest national park.

Krkonoše mountains have been inhabited since the middle ages. They were used for mining, lodging, and pasturing during the Middle Ages. Today, the primary source of income comes from tourism. But like many popular places worldwide, the Krkonoše mountains also suffer from overtourism in connection with the construction of anti-ecological ski slopes.
