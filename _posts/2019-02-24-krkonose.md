With the highest peak Sněžka just slightly surpassing the 1600 meters line, Krkonoše doesn’t belong to the world's highest mountains. However, they are the highest mountains of the Czech Republic with the oldest national park.

Inhabited since the middle ages, it was previously used for mining, lodging and pasturing. Today, the main source of income comes from tourism. But like many popular places all over the world, the Krkonoše mountains also suffer from overturism, in connection with the construction of anti-ecological ski slopes.
