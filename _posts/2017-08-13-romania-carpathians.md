Our hiking trip to Munții Apuseni started on a rainy day in a small town of Ciucea. We walked through a deep valley following a small creek, but after a few kilometers, we started to climb up to the misty mountains.

## Views from the Munții Apuseni mountain ridge
The mountain ridge we followed for the rest of our trip supplied us with everything needed: beautiful outlooks, an occasional shadow of the forest, fresh water and vast fields of blueberries. We walked in the southern direction bypassing the Floroiu dam, meeting just wild deers and a few locals (willing to sell us a cheese when asked).

Our first contact with *civilization* happened in the Stâna de Vale village, where we were trying to refill our supply. After an unsuccessful attempt to find a shop, I bought two loaves of bread in the hotel kitchen and quickly rushed back to the ridge.

## Uncivilized civilization near caves
As we were approaching Cascada Bohodei waterfalls, first tourists start to appear, but it was still a rare encounter until the Cetatea Rădesei cave. This cave system, which you can freely walk through (if the water level allows you), attract crowds of people. On the flip side, it allows us to hitchhike to our next destination, Glăvoi camp.

Glăvoi camp is located near the Cetățile Ponorului, a connected system of caves and abyss. The camp itself was full of international tourists, which decided to visit the caves the next day. Fortunately for us, they got out of beds in *normal* time and when we were around 10 a.m. already leaving this beautiful natural scenery, the flock of people was still on the way there.
