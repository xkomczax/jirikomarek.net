The Mountains Project is a collection of photos of mountains: from panoramic views from the top of the peaks to fine details in valleys.

Thanks to its inaccessibility, mountains are one of the last frontiers of wilderness.

This project contains photos from Slovakian, Ukrainian, and Romanian Carpathians, Swiss Alps, The Central Balkan mountains in Bulgaria, and from Tian Shan, Kyrgyzstan.
