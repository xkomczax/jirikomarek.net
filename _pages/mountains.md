The Mountains Project is a collection of mountains-related photos: from panoramic views from the top of the hills to details.

Thanks to its inaccessibility, mountains are one of the last frontiers of wilderness.

This project contains photos from Slovak, Ukrainian and Romanian Carpathiens, Swiss Alps, The Central Balkan mountains in Bulgaria and from Tian Shian, Kyrgyzstan.
